## getRefamiliar();

	Imagine a child, taken away from his homeland of China to Japan. Sure, Kanji looks like his native Hanzi writing system, but the meaning doesn’t exactly translate the same. Like a child stripped of language, I felt the same shift learning JavaScript after learning Java (but definitely on a less dramatic scale). Java was the first computer language I learned, which almost felt like a 2nd language to me when I was using it every day to complete my homework assignments in high school. But after the culmination of other languages (C, C++) as I progressed in my academic career, I felt as if Java was slowly fading away from me. So the revitalization of Java through JavaScript in my Software Engineering class was really motivating for me to continue to improve and rediscover my love for my “first language”.

	Yet an issue I came across was that I had learned Java, not JavaScript initially. While they sound practically the same, they each have their own quirks that forced me to rewire how I thought and coded. Javascript followed many of the same principles and ideas as JavaScript (object-oriented programming, classes, functions, etc.) but the syntax was sometimes different, so I had to force myself to remember to write with JavaScript syntax (let/const/var instead of int… which happened many times in my code) so that my code could function properly. 

A lot of my time during this process of learning Java was spent reviewing the concepts I have learned previously but in another syntax. Yet with JavaScript's ES6, there were also a bunch of features that I had learned for the first time.


## getWorking();

In the context of programming, this has always been true. The difficult problems have always been different, although changes in technology can change the landscape quite a bit. "Business" type applications are the things that come to mind for me. Those types of applications are usually coupled in some way with people ... and people are awfully hard to deal with!

Consider that one of the most popular content management systems is also considered the most horrible - Wordpress. But really, is there anything that fills that need? If it was so easy in the first place, where is the solution? Where's the magic CMS that is designed well enough that everyone hops on the boat to use it?

Some things are just difficult - building applications that humans use is hard, and will probably be hard for at least the near future.

Ever hear people ragging on engineering companies for delivering late and way over budget? Well, some engineering jobs are really difficult, especially if the requirements and funding are undulating underneath you. Because of the nature of the problem, sometimes engineering firms require large amounts of engineers and workers, inviting further problems and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project at home has become this sort of poster child of failure, budget overrun and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Well, working though regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems like it's a mind bogglingly difficult job to do. Granted, there might be some fishy stuff going on, but I refuse to believe that everyone is involved for nefarious reasons.

The problem of creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is difficult! I'm not sure we would have done it right, even if the best people were involved.
